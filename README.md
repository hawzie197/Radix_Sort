# Radix_Sort


This is my version of radix sort done in Python 3.

If you are not familiar with radix sort:


    Radix is a very fast sorting algorithm with a worste case running time of O(n * k) 
    and a space complexity of O(n+k). Where K is the length of the largest number and N
    is the size of the list.

To run:

    - download or clone the repository.
    - Open code in a text-editor or IDE  examples(atom, notepad++, pycharm)
    - Add your number list in the code where it says, "number list goes here"
    - Open a terminal and type  python3 radix.py
